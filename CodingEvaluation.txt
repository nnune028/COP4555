This is where I practice F#.

Coding Evaluation:

01/11/2018: Of course, as a beginner in F#, I began with a "Hello, World!" program. This is where I learned about printfn, the printf function that has a carriage return (like Java's System.out.println). Two semicolons allow us to execute the statement in interactive.

01/12/2018: Then, I used a function discussed in the functions video (choose) for the sake of learning how functions, parameters, and tuples work in F# as well as how to properly implement the match statements, which were not in the original code. If statements were used, but I changed it so that match statements were used. The output was the exact same, meaning my alteration of the code worked.

01/13/2018: In PlayingWithLists.fs, I learned about the List.map operation, which applies a function to every element of a list, the List.rev operation, which reverses a list, and the use of lists in a function.

02/04/2018: For LastElement.fs, I went online and looked for good F# practice exercises. I found a site that has many problems. The solutions are given, but they are hidden unless I want to access them. I do the exercises and then try to run them on interactive. If I can't run them, I try again. Only after so many attempts do I look at the solution, which helps me understand my mistakes anyway. I think I'll keep doing this for now. It's a good way to familiarize myself with F#.

02/08/2018: For FindLength.fs, I know there is an easier way to find the length of a list in F#, but I feel that understanding how it is actually implemented would help me get a better understanding of how F# works. It's also good recursion practice.

I'm really sorry if more practice was expected. It's difficult for me to squeeze in time for practice since I'm taking 12 credits and working 50 hours a week (not including another commitment I have that takes up 10-15 hours a week). Please contact me if there's anything you'd like to suggest. I do want to do well in this class.
