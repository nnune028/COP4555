This is where I practice F#.

Coding Evaluation:

Of course, as a beginner in F#, I began with a "Hello, World!" program. This is where I learned about printfn, the printf function that has a carriage return (like Java's System.out.println). Two semicolons allow us to execute the statement in interactive.

Then, I used a function discussed in the functions video (choose) for the sake of learning how functions, parameters, and tuples work in F# as well as how to properly implement the match statements, which were not in the original code. If statements were used, but I changed it so that match statements were used. The output was the exact same, meaning my alteration of the code worked.
