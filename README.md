This is where I practice F#.

Coding Evaluation:

Of course, as a beginner in F#, I began with a "Hello, World!" program. This is where I learned about printfn, the printf function that has a carriage return (like Java's System.out.println). Two semicolons allow us to execute the statement in interactive.

Then, I used a function discussed in the functions video (choose) for the sake of learning how functions, parameters, and tuples work in F# as well as how to properly implement the match statements, which were not in the original code. If statements were used, but I changed it so that match statements were used. The output was the exact same, meaning my alteration of the code worked.

In PlayingWithLists.fs, I learned about the List.map operation, which applies a function to every element of a list, the List.rev operation, which reverses a list, and the use of lists in a function.

For LastElement.fs, I went online and looked for good F# practice exercises. I found a site that has many problems. The solutions are given, but they are hidden unless I want to access them. I do the exercises and then try to run them on interactive. If I can't run them, I try again. Only after so many attempts do I look at the solution, which helps me understand my mistakes anyway. I think I'll keep doing this for now. It's a good way to familiarize myself with F#.
